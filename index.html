      <p>We are a group of high school students who are academically inclined in the field of machine learning research. In our mission to contribute to ML research academia, we have come together to work on pursuing research projects and initiatives that interest us. </p>
      <p>Our goal is to continue pursuing projects that we find interesting and hopefully expand upon what we already know. We hope that by doing this, we can learn more and improve our ability and skills. </p>
